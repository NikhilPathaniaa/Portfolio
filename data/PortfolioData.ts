  content: `
  The Muziris (Malabar Trading Company) operates three distinct business models
  under a single brand: online retail, café operations, and a B2B vending
  machine rental business.

  The objective was to design and build a unified digital platform that could
  support all three businesses while maintaining clear user journeys,
  operational transparency, and long-term scalability.
  `,
  challenge: `
  The primary challenge was consolidating three fundamentally different business workflows into one website without 
  creating complexity for users or internal staff.

  Each business required a different approach:
  - B2C e-commerce with secure payments and inventory control
  - Café branding with dynamic content and social integration
  - B2B lead generation with trust, tracking, and follow-ups

  Additionally, the platform needed strong security, spam protection, and internal visibility 
  without relying on multiple disconnected tools.
  `,
  solution: `
  I approached this as a multi-business platform using a modular, version-based delivery strategy.

  <b>Online Retail (E-commerce)</b>
  - Secure user authentication and customer accounts
  - Cart and checkout with Razorpay payments
  - Shipping integration using NimbusPost
  - Customer profiles with saved addresses, favorites, and order history
  - Inventory and stock management with out-of-stock handling
  - Multi-user admin access and global inventory control

  <b>B2B Vending Machine Rental</b>
  - Dedicated section with product videos and use cases
  - Custom inquiry forms for rental leads
  - Lead data stored in CMS and synced to Google Sheets
  - Internal status tracking for follow-ups and conversions
  - CMS-driven B2B testimonials to build trust and credibility

  <b>Café & Multi-Outlet Presence</b>
  - Menu management, image gallery, and location details
  - Designed to support multiple café outlets
  - Instagram integration planned and delivered in V2
  - CMS-driven content updates without developer dependency

  <b>Unified Contact & Security Layer</b>
  - Single dynamic contact system handling all business inquiries
  - Smart routing based on inquiry type
  - Google reCAPTCHA, form validation, and honeypot fields
  - Input sanitization to protect against spam and bots

  The platform was launched early as a stable V1, with advanced features rolled out incrementally through V2 and future versions.
  `,
  result: `
  The Muziris platform became a single digital backbone for all three businesses.

  The system enabled:
  - Smooth online sales and secure payments
  - Better inventory and order visibility
  - Simplified lead tracking and staff follow-ups
  - Reduced manual operations
  - Improved trust for both B2C and B2B customers

  The platform is scalable, secure, and built to evolve without disrupting live operations. 
  The client continues as a long-term retained partner.
